/**
 * Icon Components Barrel File
 * 
 * This file serves as a centralized export point for all icon components,
 * allowing for cleaner imports throughout the application.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * ```tsx
 * import { IconArrowRight } from '@/components/ui/icons';
 * 
 * // Then use in JSX
 * <IconArrowRight size={20} color="#6366f1" animated glow />
 * ```
 */

// Export all icon components
export { default as IconArrowRight } from './IconArrowRight';

// Additional icon exports will be added here as the library grows
